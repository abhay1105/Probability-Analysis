# Probability-Analysis

In simpler terms, this project is an R study focused on finding the probability of a "tie" between two or more groups.

To start, let's ask ourselves the following: if Person A and Person B were to flip a fair coin 50 times, what's the probability that both of these persons tie (or, in other words, what's the probability they get the same number of heads with the same number of flips)?

Although this scenario may appear straightforward at first glance, we soon begin to notice that different factors bring in new layers of complexity to the problem; for example, what if we were to increase the number of players in the game? or change the coin to something with more outcomes? or sample our numbers from a distribution that isn't uniform?

Once we consider these factors, we soon find it far more difficult to create a generalized formuala for the probability of a tie. In this study, we'll make some progress towards that end goal by asking similar questions and modelling different scenarios.

**This study is designed to investigate the probability of multiple groups having similar averages as the environment in which a sample is drawn from is varied. Through the use of computer simulations and discrete mathematics, the aim of this study is targetted towards identifying how the probability of a tie is calculated.**

<br>

So far, this analysis has been based off a hypothetical situation in which two people, Person A and Person B, are each rolling a multi-faced die, with $s$ number of sides, $t$ number of times. Each face of the die is assigned a value from 1 to $s$ and all of the faces have an equal chance of being rolled. After the rolls are conducted, the combined sum of all of the rolls is calculated and an average value per roll is determined. The goal is then to figure out the probability of Person A's average being the same as Person B's.

<br>

With the help of computer simulations, a plausible relationship between $s$, the number of sides on the multi-faced die, and $t$, the number of times the die is rolled, was obtained. The relationship is as follows: $P(s, t) = \frac{1}{s\sqrt{t}}$, where $P$ represents the probability of Person A and Person B having the same average value per roll considering that both people have a die with $s$ number of faces and roll it $t$ number of times.

<br>

However, in order to confirm the validity of this relationship, our study must also be able to prove this connection theoretically. Therefore, the following scenarios were created as an insight into the mathematical reasoning of this relationship.

Person A --> Rolling a sum of 1 -->   1   --> $1 * \frac{1}{2}$

Person A --> Rolling a sum of 2 -->   2   --> $1 * \frac{1}{2}$

<br>

Since Person B is rolling an identical die the same number of times as Person A, the probabilities for each of the aforementioned possibilities are the same; therefore, the probability of Person A and Person B having a tie is:

$$\frac{1}{2}^{2} + \frac{1}{2}^{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$$

Person A --> Rolling a sum of 2 -->   1  1             --> $1 * (\frac{1}{2})(\frac{1}{2})$

Person A --> Rolling a sum of 3 -->   1  2  ||  2  1   --> $2 * (\frac{1}{2})(\frac{1}{2})$

Person A --> Rolling a sum of 4 -->   2  2             --> $1 * (\frac{1}{2})(\frac{1}{2})$

<br>

Since Person B is rolling an identical die the same number of times as Person A, the probabilities for each of the aforementioned possibilities are the same; therefore, the probability of Person A and Person B having a tie is:

$$\frac{1}{4}^{2} + \frac{2}{4}^{2} + \frac{1}{4}^{2} = \frac{1}{16} + \frac{4}{16} + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{6}{16} = \frac{3}{8}$$

Person A --> Rolling a sum of 4 -->   1  2  1  (x3)   --> $3 * (\frac{1}{2})(\frac{1}{2})(\frac{1}{2})$

Person A --> Rolling a sum of 5 -->   2  2  1  (x3)   --> $3 * (\frac{1}{2})(\frac{1}{2})(\frac{1}{2})$

Person A --> Rolling a sum of 6 -->   2  2  2         --> $1 * (\frac{1}{2})(\frac{1}{2})(\frac{1}{2})$

<br>

Since Person B is rolling an identical die the same number of times as Person A, the probabilities for each of the aforementioned possibilities are the same; therefore, the probability of Person A and Person B having a tie is:

$$\frac{1}{8}^{2} + \frac{3}{8}^{2} + \frac{3}{8}^{2} + \frac{1}{8}^{2} = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{9}{64} + \frac{9}{64} + \frac{1}{64} = \frac{20}{64} = \frac{5}{16}$$

Since Person B is rolling an identical die the same number of times as Person A, the probabilities for each of the aforementioned possibilities are the same; therefore, the probability of Person A and Person B having a tie is:

$$\frac{1}{3}^{2} + \frac{1}{3}^{2} + \frac{1}{3}^{2} = \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{9} = \frac{1}{3}$$

Since Person B is rolling an identical die the same number of times as Person A, the probabilities for each of the aforementioned possibilities are the same; therefore, the probability of Person A and Person B having a tie is:

$$\frac{1}{9}^{2} + \frac{2}{9}^{2} + \frac{3}{9}^{2} + \frac{2}{9}^{2} + \frac{1}{9}^{2} = \frac{1}{81} + \frac{4}{81} + \frac{9}{81} + \frac{4}{81} + \frac{1}{81} = \frac{19}{81}$$

After observing the outcomes of the examples above, it is reasonable to assume that the mathematics involved here utilize an application of the binomial theorem, in which the binomial coefficient is defined by:

$$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$
